											<h3>Interesting Data Visualizations Quotes</h3>
											<p style="color:gray;">“Visualization gives you answers to questions you didn’t know you had.” </p>
												<p>– Ben Schneiderman</p>
											<p style="font-size:14 px;">“By visualizing information, we turn it into a landscape that you can explore with your eyes. A sort of information map. And when you’re lost in information, an information map is kind of useful.”</p>
											<p>– David McCandless</p>

											<h3>Visualization Projects</h3>
											<a href="https://github.com/downtownEB24/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/AirlineData_ProjectExplanations.pdf">Visualization of airline data using Plotly package in R</a>
											<p><b>Project Objective:</b>
											The package I will be exploring for my STAT 484 project, will be R’s plotly library. I will be using the R graphing package to make interactive graphs, displaying information pertaining to airliner travel data. One concept, I will try to address with the data, is where most people like to go to using different airline companies such as Delta Airlines, United Airlines, American Airlines, British Airways, and etc.… I also hope to display which airports in the US have the most flight delays and corelate the delay data to other attributes. For reasons why airports have delays. Whether it be because of the weather, number of passengers in the airport, or runway and/or taxiway maintenance. Some charts I hope to use, to display the travel data will be barplots, histograms, maps/heatmaps, and scatterplots.</p>

											<a href="https://github.com/downtownEB24/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/python_visualizationMtcars.ipynb">Brief Visualization using Mtcars in Python</a>
											<p><b>Assignment Objective:</b>
											Using python add-on libraries such as matplotlib and pandas plot methods to answer certain questions regarding the built-in R dataset called mtcars. The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine. That contains information about fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).</p>

											<p><b>Assignment Objective:</b>
											The goal of this assignment is to use one dimensional and time series analysis techniques to create visualizations that provide insight into patterns over time in more than 7 million flights from about a dozen US airline carriers. Four visualizations were created in total and brief explanations were written to summarize my findings.</p>

											<a style="font-size:18px;" href="https://github.com/downtownEB24/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/TwitterData_TableauVisualsExplanations.pdf">Explanations of Twitter Data Visualizations</a><br>
											<p><b>Assignment Objective:</b>
											The goal of this assignment is to use techniques that are used to visualize proportional data. We will be working with twitter data for a fictitious company. The data consists of tweets for the month of December 2015. The format of the data is exactly as it comes when downloaded from analytics.twitter.com. We will be trying to understand Twitter data that pertains to topics such as promotion tweets, organic tweets, replies, and impressions.</p>

											<a style="font-size:18px;" href="https://github.com/downtownEB24/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/Visual_Ed_Perform_Exp.pdf">Explanations of Student Performance (Based on Alcohol Consumption) Dashboard</a><br>
											<p><b>Project Objective:</b>
											The goal of this project was to understand why students preformed well or poorly in school based on their choice to drink alcohol during the school year. I based my student population sample from data collected from two Portuguese schools named Gabriel Pereia and Mousinho da Silveria. And the scores which were evaluated were Math scores between the students of the two schools. Ultimately, I used a Tableau dashboard to gain inferences about student’s performance in conjunction with their alcohol compunction through various attributes such as a student’s family size, age, sex, parent education level, study time, etc.</p>
