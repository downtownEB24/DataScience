											<h3>Interesting Machine Learning Quotes</h3>
											<p style="color:gray;">“As more and more artificial intelligence is entering into the world, more and more emotional intelligence must enter into leadership.”</p>
												<p>– Amit Ray</p>
											<p style="font-size:14 px;">“You have to talk about ‘The Terminator’ if you’re talking about artificial intelligence. I actually think that that’s way off. I don’t think that an artificially intelligent system that has superhuman intelligence will be violent. I do think that it will disrupt our culture.”</p>
											<p>– Gray Scott</p>

											<p><b>Project Objective:</b>
											The goal of this project was to explore two types of datasets (transactions of online based company & wine data) and perform data cleaning tasks to prepare datasets for analysis. Once the completion of data collection and data cleaning processes, machine learning algorithms were used to conduct time series analysis on the prescribed datasets. In order to answer questions like which model best predicted the outcome variable of the wine dataset. As well as, which model best predicted the future customer purchase amount from the online retail store website. Machine Learning techniques used in throughout this project included ARIMA, Logistic Regression, CART, C5.0, Neural Networks, and Bayesian Networks.</p>

											<p><b>Project Objective:</b>
											The goal for this project was to explore three datasets (user_features.csv, product_feature.csv, click_history.csv) containing hypothetical website advertisement information. The advertisement sent by this imaginative company contained questions regarding customers’ opinion of the company’s website. In conjunction to what type of products customers buy from the company’s website, as well. As always, data cleaning and preprocessing was initiated in the beginning before model generation and evaluation was started. However, once the datasets were cleaned and explored to check for data abnormalities, machine learning algorithms were created to predict whether a customer/website user would click on an advertisement sent via email, based on certain factors. Such as if customers had ordered a product before on the company’s website, whether a product was on sale, whether the product review score was high, or the number of reviews for a product was high. The machine learning techniques used in this project were Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.</p>

											<p><b>Assignment Objective:</b>
											The goal of this assignment was to use natural language processing to count word frequencies and understand the meaning of word patterns of file names written in an imported text file. Mainly using Python’s Pandas package NLTK. To answer questions such as how many file names are listed, how many file names match a prescribed file name pattern, and frequency word count of their occurrences in the text file through word tokenization (splitting text into a list of words, removing special characters, performing stemming and/or lemmatization on each word).</p>

											<p><b>Assignment Objective:</b>
											The goal of this assignment was to use two machine learning models (neural network & C5.0) to predict whether certain factors play a role in determining if a person will experience a heart-attack. These factors included attributes such as high blood pressure, whether a person had an active or sedentary lifestyle, cholesterol level, age, and gender. All of the patient information was imported from an excel file.</p>
