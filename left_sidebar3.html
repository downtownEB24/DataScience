											<h3>Statistical Programming Projects</h3>

											<a style="font-size:18px;" href="https://github.com/downtownEB24/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/Machine_Learning_Project_Explanations.pdf">Explanations of Project Code</a><br>
											<p><b>Assignment Objective:</b>
											In this assignment I used a two-way analysis of variance test to see if changes in levels of categorical predictor variables would cause change in the mean of a quantitative response variable. I then used an interaction plot to try an explain if there was any interaction between the predictor and response variable. In the assignment I also used a t-test to analyze the mean output variable of two independent groups to see if there were any differences between one another. Another test statistic that was used in this assignment was the kappa coefficient. The kappa coefficient was used to measure the level of agreement between three cutoff values as well as between two independent groups. Next in the assignment I used a logistic regression procedure to predict a binary outcome of a categorical group based on two other independent/predictor variables. Lastly, in the assignment I used a frequency test to see if any change occurred on a numeric variable based on different levels of an ordinal predictor variable of the dataset. After which I tested for association between the two variables with a chi-square test.</p>

											<p><b>Project Objective:</b>
											The goal for this project was to explore three datasets (user_features.csv, product_feature.csv, click_history.csv) containing hypothetical website advertisement information. The advertisement sent by this imaginative company contained questions regarding customers’ opinion of the company’s website. In conjunction to what type of products customers buy from the company’s website, as well. As always, data cleaning and preprocessing was initiated in the beginning before model generation and evaluation was started. However, once the datasets were cleaned and explored to check for data abnormalities, machine learning algorithms were created to predict whether a customer/website user would click on an advertisement sent via email, based on certain factors. Such as if customers had ordered a product before on the company’s website, whether a product was on sale, whether the product review score was high, or the number of reviews for a product was high. The machine learning techniques used in this project were Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.</p>

											<p><b>Assignment Objective:</b>
											The goal of this assignment was to use natural language processing to count word frequencies and understand the meaning of word patterns of file names written in an imported text file. Mainly using Python’s Pandas package NLTK. To answer questions such as how many file names are listed, how many file names match a prescribed file name pattern, and frequency word count of their occurrences in the text file through word tokenization (splitting text into a list of words, removing special characters, performing stemming and/or lemmatization on each word).</p>

											<p><b>Assignment Objective:</b>
											The goal of this assignment was to use two machine learning models (neural network & C5.0) to predict whether certain factors play a role in determining if a person will experience a heart-attack. These factors included attributes such as high blood pressure, whether a person had an active or sedentary lifestyle, cholesterol level, age, and gender. All of the patient information was imported from an excel file.</p>
